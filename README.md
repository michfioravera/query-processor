## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

This project employs a minimal, dependency-free architecture leveraging modern web technologies:

**Frontend (index.html, style.css)** - Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, ensuring fast load times and broad browser compatibility.

**Service Worker (sw.js)** - Implements offline capabilities and intercepts fetch requests to handle API interactions locally.

**Serverless API (netlify/functions/api.js)** - Deployed via Netlify Functions, processes query parameters and returns JSON data.

**Deployment Configuration (netlify.toml)** - Manages routing, functions, and build settings for deployment.
